# portfo

--> In this project I have used Python in Web Development. Also using Python, we created our database, our own server, our own portfolio webpage, where peope can view our portfolio's and submit a request to work with you or send you a message and store it in database.

--> my portfolio URL :- https://binny.pythonanywhere.com/

--> Also attached requirements.txt file which is actually used for specifying what python packages along with versions are required to run the project.
